# 00001. Record Decisions initialization

2024-01-15

## Status

__Final__

## Context

All decisions and chnges to the Pietenpol project should be traceble and documented in a structured way. Using the ADR-CLI tool, its easier to add and manage these decision records from the command line.

## Decision

We will keep a collection of records for "significant" decisions: those that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, or construction techniques. As this recording is
started at a later time, some decision records will be out of order.

## Consequences

See [cognitect 2011.11.15](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) for more information about ADR's.

This documentation is created using the [adr-cli tool](https://github.com/gjkaal/adr-cli).
