## Context

Not any type of glue is accepted for constructing aircraft. The main choice is between epoxy and aerodux (although some still use aerolite) Each type of bonding material has its pro's and cons.

### Aerolite

Like Aerodux and Epoxy, Aerolite is a two-component system. A powder resin is mixed with warm water into a thin brushable cream and the hardener is applied to the mating surface.
The two parts are then clamped in close contact for the set to be completed. Working or open time depends on the ambient temperature and humidity but will be in the region 
of 5-25 minutes. Similarly the clamping time will be influenced by these factors but will need to be left for 1.1/2 - 3.1/2 hours. However, full strength may take up to 14 days to acquire.

### Aerodux

Aerodux 185 must always be mixed with a hardener powder (HRP 155) prior to use. To obtain bonds of maximal water resistance it is essential that the correct hardener dosage is used.
Prior to mixing, the mixing and application equipment must be clean. The mixing ratio is 100 / 20 in weight. This adds up about the same volume in powder and resin.
Open assembly time should be kept as short as possible and should not exceed 5 min. On the other hand, 5 -15 minutes closed assembly is beneficial, in particular when dense wood is being bonded.
Pot life at 25 C is about 2 hours. In the manufacture of laminated timber structures the pressure should be 0.6-1.0 N/mm² with softwoods
and 0.8-1.2 N/mm² with hardwoods. In other bonding operations a lower pressure may be sufficient. Full strength bonding may take several weeks.

### Epoxy

There are a lot of different epoxy resins. Most have a mixing ratio of 1:2 but there are others with a mixing ratio 100:35. Pot like is lower than aerodux, but open time is much longer. 
Some clamping pressure is required, but much less than with urea-formaldehyde glues (like Aerolite and Aerodux). This is because of the low shrinkage of the epoxy while setting. The downside
is that epoxy is more likely to run off, but there are epoxies with a higher viscosity.

## Decision

### Considerations

Using aerodux seems to be the most accepted solution for the construction of wooden aircraft, due to its track record and the fact that it is rot-resistant and acts as a deterant for insects.
Aerolite is acceptable, but the method of construction, with one component on one part and the other component on the other, has lead to issues is the past. Epoxy is readily available, but
the wide choice of types, could lead to issues.

### Conclusion

For load bearing structures, and as a primary bonding agent, aerodux is used througout. For parts that are difficult to clamp and for non-load bearing structures, a filling epoxy resin is used.
The same epoxy can be used for conserving wooden parts.
