__New__

## Context

I started building an aircraft with little or no experience how to build an aeroplane from scratch. So one of the things I did
was searching printed information about what kind of plane to build, how to design one and what kind of materials are used.

## Decision

We will keep a collection of records for "architecturally significant" decisions: those that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques.

## Consequences

See [cognitect 2011.11.15](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) for more information about ADR's.

This documentation is created using the (adr-cli tool)[https://github.com/gjkaal/adr-cli].
